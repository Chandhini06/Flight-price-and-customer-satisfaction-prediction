# Flight-price-and-customer-satisfaction-prediction

This project focuses on predicting flight prices and customer satisfaction using machine learning. The Flight Price Prediction model utilizes factors like airline, duration hours, and total stops to estimate ticket prices, with XGBoost as the best-performing algorithm. Meanwhile, the Customer Satisfaction Prediction model classifies passenger satisfaction based on service-related attributes, employing XGBoost and handling class imbalance with SMOTE. Both models are tracked and optimized using MLflow, ensuring efficient model management. Additionally, an interactive Streamlit app enables real-time predictions and insights. This project empowers airlines to optimize pricing strategies, enhance customer experience, and drive data-driven decision-making.
